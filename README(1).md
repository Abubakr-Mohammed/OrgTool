## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
- While building OrgTool, I learned how to effectively manage and structure a full web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I deepened my understanding of organizing tasks in a dynamic UI, managing data flow, and ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- One of the main challenges I faced was optimizing task scheduling and calendar integration to ensure smooth performance. To overcome this, I applied efficient data structures like arrays and hash maps to handle large datasets, which improved the app's performance and scalability. Additionally, I faced UI/UX challenges in creating a user-friendly design, which I resolved by iterating on feedback from beta testers to refine the layout and functionality.
